Scenario: 

You are a cybersecurity analyst and you have been given a task to decrypt a highly sensitive message that was intercepted during a surveillance operation. The message was encrypted using a custom encryption algorithm that is based on the RSA encryption system. The encryption was done using a public key and the decryption can only be done using the corresponding private key. However, the private key has been lost and the only thing you have is the encrypted message and a list of possible private keys that might have been used for encryption. Your task is to try each of these keys and find the correct one that can successfully decrypt the message.

Vulnerability: 

This challenge is based on the vulnerability of weak key generation in RSA encryption. The encryption process might have been done with a weak private key which can be easily factored, making it easier for an attacker to obtain the private key and decrypt the message.

Difficulty: 

This challenge is considered to be of a high difficulty level as it requires the participant to have a good understanding of the RSA encryption system and how it works, as well as the ability to perform complex mathematical operations to factor large numbers and find the correct private key that can decrypt the message. Additionally, the challenge requires the participant to have a good understanding of the different methods and techniques used to factor large numbers and to be able to implement them in a script.

Steps to solve the challenge:
1.	Understand the RSA encryption system and how it works.
2.	Try each of the provided private keys and see if it can decrypt the message.
3.	If none of the provided keys can decrypt the message, try to factor the public key to obtain the private key.
4.	Use the correct private key to decrypt the message and find the flag.
5.	Keep in mind that factoring large numbers is a computationally intensive task, so the script should be optimized for performance and efficiency.
6.	If necessary, use a library or tool that can perform the factoring efficiently.
